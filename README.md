From this directory run ./Bash/Provision/installScript.sh

```sh
cd ./Bash/Provision/
chmod u+x ./installscripts.sh
sudo ./installscripts.sh
```

_N.B: You will need to refresh you shell session for the programs to become available._

*TODO:* check if the `./Bash/Provision/*` files need chmod u+x for each.
